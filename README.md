# FinSight API Server

finsight api server using epilogue and sequelize to interface with postgres db.    

Used in conjunction with [finsight client app](https://github.com/rramteerath/finsight)  

Review [Epilogue Sample](https://github.com/rramteerath/epilogue-sample) and [associated blog post](https://thearchangle.wordpress.com/2016/01/19/create-a-simple-rest-server-using-epilogue/) for a quick how-to on using epilogue.  

As the API requirements become more complex, replace the simplicity/inflexibility of epilogue with a full node/express rest server. Optionally write in scala.

##Install
```sh
npm install
```

##Run
```sh
node server
```
